## 1. Identification: Is it really a Cockroach?

Before we discuss treatment, let's confirm what you are seeing. In North Carolina, we primarily deal with two types:

### The German Cockroach (*Blattella germanica*)

* **Size**: Small, about 1/2 inch long.
* **Color**: Light brown with two dark stripes on the pronotum.
* **Behavior**: Found in kitchens and bathrooms. They reproduce rapidly and are a major health hazard.

### The American Cockroach (*Periplaneta americana*)

* **Size**: Large, up to 2-3 inches.
* **Color**: Reddish-brown.
* **Behavior**: Often called "Palmetto Bugs", they prefer damp basements and sewers but will invade homes for food.

## 2. The Dangers of Ignoring the Problem

Many Wilmington residents ignore the early signs, leading to costly consequences.

Cockroaches are known vectors for Salmonella, E. coli, and other dangerous bacteria. Their droppings can also trigger severe biological reactions in children and pets.

## 3. Prevention & Treatment Strategies

* **Moisture Control**: Wilmington's humidity is a breeding ground. Use dehumidifiers in crawl spaces.
* **Sealing Entry Points**: Caulk windows and doors. Install door sweeps.
* **Sanitation**: Eliminate food sources. Store food in airtight containers and clean up crumbs immediately.
* **Professional Barrier**: DIY sprays often fail because they repel roaches into walls rather than killing them. Our perimeter defense stops them at the source using non-repellent transfer technology.
