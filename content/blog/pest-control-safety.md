# Pest Control Safety: Your Questions Answered

*Apex Guard Semantic FAQ - Wilmington Edition*

## Common Concerns

### Is professional pest control safe for my pets?
**Answer**: Yes. At Apex Guard, we use the "Ryan Protocol," which involves pet-safe products and specific drying times (usually 30-60 minutes) before pets re-enter the treated area.

### How often should I treat my home in Wilmington?
**Answer**: Due to our humid coastal climate, quarterly treatments are recommended. For high-activity areas near the Cape Fear River, bi-monthly may be necessary.

### DIY vs. Professional: Which is better?
**Answer**: DIY sprays often only kill contact pests. Professional treatments use micro-encapsulated products that the pests take back to the nest, eliminating the colony source.
